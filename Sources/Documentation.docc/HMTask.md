# ``HMTask``

Extended functionality for [Task](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/task).

## An asynchronous get-only throwing property wrapper?

Although `Task` qualifies as being a "[throwing property wrapper](https://github.com/Catterwaul/Thrappture)", and has a lot in common with `Result`, in particular, it has some key differences to its synchronous cousins.

First, unlike mutable `Optional`s and `Result`s, the value of a `Task` exclusively makes sense to be `get`-only. Although it's not currently possible in Swift, it might make sense for an asynchronous *property* to be settableâ€”but not the `value` of a `Task`.

### Usage Examples

You've got the source code, so aside from reading this documentation, see the **Tests** folder for example usage! ðŸ˜º

### Duplicates for `Never` and `any Error` 

*Working with `Task`s often requires an overload for each of the two supported `Failure` types.*
